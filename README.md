# News Summarizer
Welcome to my News Summarizer project!
  This project scrapes news articles from famous news engines and aims to summarize the top-most articles through sentence fragmentation, keyword identification and weighted words in the text. 
  This is built using nltk, Flask, and Beautiful Soup.
